# casinoroulette

Using ozboware/javascript-roulette project. I decided to expand the roulette gui table that he built by creating a full game with an account and banking based system.

I utilized mysql.connector for the connection between flask/python and the database. 

Each account has it's own account balance with both deposit and withdraw options.
